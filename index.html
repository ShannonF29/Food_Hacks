<h3>Indomie and Plantain</h3>
<p> This is something im sure that you normally make at home, this is one of the easiest and quickest meals to make. Indomie is another way to say noodles. You can buy a packet of noodles from any local store near to you and you should be able to buy a few packs for no less than 2 pounds. Plantain can be bought at a local corner shop and you can get three or two for a pound. You would cook it over a stove.</p>
